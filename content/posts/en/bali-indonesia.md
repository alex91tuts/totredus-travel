### Uluwatu Temple

Located on a high cliff above the ocean, Uluwatu Temple is one of the most beautiful temples in Bali. The visit at sunset is particularly impressive, when the sun sinks into the ocean, creating an unforgettable landscape.

### Kuta Beach

Kuta Beach is perfect for surfing and relaxation. With fine white sand and crystal clear waters, it's an ideal place to spend a day in the sun.

For adventure lovers, the trip to Mount Batur to see the sunrise is an unforgettable experience. The active volcano offers spectacular panoramic views of the island.

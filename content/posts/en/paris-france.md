## My First Impression

When I first arrived in Paris, I was overwhelmed by the beauty and elegance of the city. Every corner explored seems to tell a story, every building seems to be a work of art.

## What to Visit

### The Eiffel Tower

The most recognizable symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower, is an unforgettable experience. Built for the 1889 Universal Exposition, the tower offers spectacular panoramic views of the city. We recommend visiting the tower at sunset, when the city is illuminated by thousands of lights.

### The Louvre Museum

One of the largest and most important museums in the world, the Louvre houses over 35,000 works of art, including Leonardo da Vinci's famous Mona Lisa. The museum is located in an impressive historic palace and is worth setting aside at least a full day to explore.

### Notre-Dame Cathedral

Although currently under renovation after the 2019 fire, Notre-Dame Cathedral remains a powerful symbol of Paris. Its Gothic architecture and long history make it an unforgettable destination.

### Arc de Triomphe

Located in the center of Place Charles de Gaulle, the Arc de Triomphe offers an excellent panoramic view of the city. Built to commemorate Napoleon's victories, the arch is an impressive monument worth visiting.

## Parisian Cuisine

Paris is known for its refined cuisine. From fresh croissants in the morning to coq au vin in the evening, every meal is an experience. Don't miss trying:

- **Croissants** from a local bakery
- **Macarons** from Ladurée or Pierre Hermé
- **Steak frites** at a traditional restaurant
- **Wine** from French regions

## Practical Tips

- **Transport**: The Paris metro is efficient and accessible. Purchase a Navigo pass for unlimited travel.

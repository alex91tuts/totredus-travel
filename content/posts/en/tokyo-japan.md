## An Experience of Contrast

What impressed me most about Tokyo is how tradition and modernity coexist in perfect harmony. On the same day, you can visit a centuries-old temple and then lose yourself in the neon glow of modern neighborhoods.

## Places to Visit

### Senso-ji Temple

Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa is the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Visitors can explore the temples, Kaminarimon Gate, and enjoy the traditional Japanese atmosphere.

### Shibuya Crossing

The busiest intersection in the world, Shibuya Crossing is a symbol of modern Tokyo. Hundreds of people cross simultaneously at each green light, creating an impressive spectacle.

### Imperial Palace

The residence of the Emperor of Japan, the Imperial Palace, is surrounded by beautiful gardens and is a perfect place for a relaxing stroll. Although the palace is not open to the public, the gardens are accessible.

### Mount Fuji

Although located at a distance from Tokyo, Mount Fuji is worth visiting. The best view of the mountain is from Tokyo Skytree or from Shiba Park.

## Japanese Cuisine

Tokyo is a paradise for food lovers. From superior quality sushi to authentic ramen, every meal is a culinary experience:

- **Sushi** - try sushi at a small restaurant with a single counter
- **Ramen** - each neighborhood has its own favorite ramen restaurant
- **Yakitori** - traditional Japanese grills
- **Matcha** - traditional green tea

## Travel Tips

- **Transport**: Tokyo's public transport system is excellent. Purchase a Japan Rail Pass for unlimited travel.
- **Language**: Although English is not spoken everywhere, many signs are in English and people are very welcoming.
- **Accommodation**: Recommended areas include Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ginza.
- **Etiquette**: Respect Japanese traditions and culture. Remove shoes when entering temples and traditional restaurants.

## Conclusion

Tokyo is a city that transforms you. Whether you're fascinated by technology, traditional culture, or simply want to experience something completely different, Tokyo offers an unforgettable experience.
